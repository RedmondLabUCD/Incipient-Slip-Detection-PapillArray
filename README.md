# Incipient Slip Detection PapillArray
Official implementation of paper: [Robust Learning-Based Incipient Slip Detection using the PapillArray Optical Tactile Sensor for Improved Robotic Gripping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04011.pdf)

# Installation
You need to download our dataset from HERE and create a folder named 'datasets' in the root of your project. Then, place the data into this folder.

In terms of code, our code does not have any specific requirements for Python packages; it relies on relatively basic packages such as PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and others. If you encounter any errors, they can be easily resolved.

We also offer the pretrained models within the "pre-trained-models" directory in this repository.
